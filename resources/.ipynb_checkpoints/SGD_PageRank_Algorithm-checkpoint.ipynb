    "# Stochastic Gradient Descent PageRank (SGD PageRank)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a detailed algorithmic description for a SGD PageRank implementation tailored for graphs derived from single-cell multiomic data. The aim is to prioritize the nodes (cells) based on their topological importance, refined by SGD to handle large-scale data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Neighborhood Hopping\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the extended topological features of the graph, we implement dynamic neighborhood hopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^{(\\alpha)} = A^{\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( A \\) is the adjacency matrix, and \\( \\alpha \\) is the predefined number of hops ensuring all nodes have direct paths to all other nodes within \\( \\alpha \\) hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Factor Calculation (Si)\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaling factor for each node is calculated to down-weight the influence of highly connected nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_i = \\frac{1}{\\text{degree}(i)} + C(D_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( C(D_i) \\) represents a correction based on the node's adjacency set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Scaling (Mij)\n",
    "\n",
    "We scale the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) matrix by applying a dot product of \\( S_i \\) to both incoming and outgoing connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{ij} = S_i \\cdot M \\cdot S_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( M \\) is the KNN matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SGD PageRank Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The main algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def SGDpagerank(M, num_iterations, mini_batch_size, initial_learning_rate, tolerance, d, full_batch_update_iters, dip_window, plateau_iterations, sampling_method, init_vect=None, **kwargs):\n",
    "    # ... (implementation details)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate (Alpha)\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate is updated at each iteration to ensure convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\text{decay_rate} \\cdot \\text{iteration}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### PageRank Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "A random rank vector \\( v \\) is initialized and normalized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = \\frac{\\text{rand}(N, 1)}{\\| \\text{rand}(N, 1) \\|_1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-Batch SGD Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, a subset of nodes is selected, and the PageRank vector is updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{\\text{mini_batch}} = d \\cdot (\\alpha \\cdot M_{\\text{mini_batch}} @ v) + \\left(\\frac{1 - d}{N}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( @ \\) denotes matrix-vector multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convergence Check\n",
    "\n",
    "We monitor the L2 norm of the PageRank vector difference for convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\| v_{\\text{iter}} - v_{\\text{prev}} \\|_2 < \\text{tolerance}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full-Batch Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "After the main SGD iterations, we perform a number of full-batch updates for fine-tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = d \\cdot (M @ v) + \\left(\\frac{1 - d}{N}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Softmax Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the PageRank vector is obtained, a softmax transformation is applied to obtain a probability distribution for sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_i = \\frac{e^{v_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^N e^{v_j}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we perform sampling from the softmax-transformed PageRank scores to select nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling is done 100 times using the PageRank scores.\n",
    "- The observed probability of sampling is used to derive the output node indices at a given proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the detailed algorithmic description of the SGD PageRank methodology.\n"
